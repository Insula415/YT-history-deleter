First download selenium - if you already have it move on to the next step.

	Sudo apt-get install selenium OR pip3 install selenium
	
	Now you need to install your desired webdriver for selenium
	Search "selenium [web browser of choice] webdriver" online 
	Download the right webdriver for your web browser, you need to find your web browser version.
	
	After that unzip the webdriver in your downloads
	Now you need to move it to /usr/local/bin. 
	Type mv ~/Downloads/yourwebdrivername /usr/local/bin
	Now you have selenium

Add your information to "secrets.py"
Type python3 yt.py and enjoy!

Thanks,
